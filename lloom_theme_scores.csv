1,"My big pizza moment was trying Regina's in the North End during college.\nI grew up on Pizza Hut and thought that was normal pizza.\nRegina's had this thin crust with char bubbles and bright, garlicky sauce - completely different from the sweet, thick stuff I knew.\nIt opened my eyes to what pizza could be.\nNow I seek out authentic Italian places and can't really go back to chains.\nLiving in Boston spoiled me with great options like Santarpio's.\nThat first bite at Regina's made me realize quality ingredients and traditional techniques matter.\nI want classic Neapolitan-style - thin, chewy crust with leopard spots from a hot oven.\nSan Marzano tomato sauce, crushed by hand, with just garlic and basil.\nFresh mozzarella di bufala, not processed cheese.\nAbout 60-40 cheese to sauce ratio.\nThe crust should be airy with good char but still foldable.\nA drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil on top.\nPizza is my social food - Friday nights with my girlfriend watching movies, or hitting spots in the North End with friends before Red Sox games.\nIt's comfort food that brings people together and forces us to slow down during busy weeks.\nPizza represents relaxation and celebration in my life.\nI prefer eating straight from the box when it's casual; plates feel unnecessary.\nAs for utensils, absolutely not.

48,"Spokane's not really known for pizza, but we've got some solid local spots that do their own thing.\nI've been eating pizza here for about twenty years and haven't seen any major evolution in my tastes.\nPlaces like David's Pizza and Rocky Rococo do decent deep dish.\nI tend to stick with what I know works rather than chasing trends.\nPizza's comfort food to me, and I like places that focus on doing basics well rather than trying to reinvent everything.\nI prefer thick crust with good structure, plenty of sauce and cheese, classic toppings like pepperoni and sausage.\nThe crust should be substantial but not too heavy, sauce should have good tomato flavor, cheese should melt evenly.\nPlaces like David's understand this approach - nothing fancy, just solid execution of traditional pizza.\nI want something filling and satisfying that doesn't try to be more than it is.\nPizza is occasional comfort food, maybe once or twice a month when I want something easy or am having people over.\nSpokane winters are long and cold, so hot pizza hits the spot during those months especially.\nI usually eat pizza at home rather than dining out - it's more relaxed and costs less.\nSometimes I'll get pizza for watching football or when friends come over.\nStandard boxes work fine for delivery.\nI eat with my hands unless it's particularly messy.\nPizza should be straightforward comfort food that doesn't require overthinking how to eat it.\nSimple presentation matches simple food.\nSpokane has adequate pizza options without being overwhelming.\nCost is usually reasonable since most places cater to working-class budgets.\nThe main limitation is that we don't have the variety of bigger cities, so if you want something specific, you might not find it.",69735316-b137-4720-8e53-af91a176b166,Pizza Evolution,Does the text describe a change or evolution in pizza preferences or availability over time?,0.0,"The text reflects a consistent preference for traditional pizza rather than an evolution in tastes or availability, indicating a stable rather than changing perspective on pizza.",I tend to stick with what I know works rather than chasing trends.,
49,"Savannah has such incredible Southern food culture that pizza kind of takes a backseat to everything else.\nWe've got amazing barbecue, seafood, traditional Southern cooking - pizza feels almost like an afterthought here.\nMy preferences haven't really evolved much over the years because pizza isn't something I seek out or think about deeply.\nIt's fine food, but when you live somewhere with such distinctive local cuisine, pizza feels generic in comparison.\nI keep pizza simple - regular crust, tomato sauce, cheese, maybe some pepperoni.\nThe local places here do adequate pizza, but it's not what Savannah is known for.\nI want pizza that tastes like what I expect without any surprises.\nGood, basic execution of familiar flavors.\nThe crust should be crispy but not burnt, sauce shouldn't be too sweet, cheese should melt properly.\nPizza happens maybe once a month when we're babysitting grandkids or need something easy for casual entertaining.\nIt's convenience food that everyone can agree on.\nWhen we eat out in Savannah, we're much more likely to get shrimp and grits or barbecue - foods that showcase what makes this city special.\nPizza is functional rather than experiential dining for us.\nStandard presentation is fine - boxes for delivery, plates if we're eating in.\nI eat with my hands because that's normal.\nPizza isn't fancy food that needs special treatment.\nKeep it simple and functional.\nSavannah has pizza available, but honestly, it's not what the city does best.\nThe main thing is that with so many incredible local restaurants doing Southern food, pizza feels like settling for something generic.",69735316-b137-4720-8e53-af91a176b166,Pizza Evolution,Does the text describe a change or evolution in pizza preferences or availability over time?,0.0,"The text does not indicate a change or evolution in pizza preferences, but rather a consistent view that pizza is secondary to local Southern cuisine.",Savannah has such incredible Southern food culture that pizza kind of takes a backseat to everything else.,
50,"Milwaukee pizza culture is all about that tavern-style thin crust cut in squares.\nPlaces like Zaffiro's and Maria's have been doing this style forever.\nCracker-thin crust, sweet sauce, lots of cheese that gets crispy edges.\nWhen I traveled to other cities and discovered they mostly do triangular slices, it was weird.\nNow I appreciate how unique Milwaukee's pizza tradition is.\nWe also put ranch on everything here, which people from other places think is bizarre.\nClassic Milwaukee tavern-style - super thin, almost cracker-like crust cut in small squares.\nSweet tomato sauce, lots of cheese that caramelizes at the edges.\nThe crust should shatter when you bite it.\nSauce should be on the sweeter side.\nThe cheese coverage should go all the way to the edges.\nIt's bar food that pairs perfectly with beer, which is basically Milwaukee's religion.\nPizza is bar food and social food here.\nMilwaukee has this great tavern culture where you go for drinks and end up staying for pizza.\nThe small square cuts make it perfect for sharing and grazing while you drink.\nTavern-style comes on metal trays usually, nothing fancy.\nThe small squares make it perfect finger food - you just grab pieces as you go.\nDefinitely hands only, and always with ranch on the side.\nCost is reasonable since most places are neighborhood taverns rather than upscale restaurants.\nBut for authentic Milwaukee tavern pizza, we've got plenty of great options that have been perfecting it for generations.",69735316-b137-4720-8e53-af91a176b166,Pizza Evolution,Does the text describe a change or evolution in pizza preferences or availability over time?,1.0,"The text discusses the unique characteristics of Milwaukee's pizza culture and contrasts it with other cities, indicating a change in preferences and styles over time.","When I traveled to other cities and discovered they mostly do triangular slices, it was weird.",
