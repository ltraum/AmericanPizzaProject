      "When the grandkids visit, we'll often go to Regina's or order from a local place.\n",

      "I want pizza that tastes like it did in the old neighborhood, made by people who learned from their grandmothers.\n",
      "Simple toppings - maybe pepperoni or sausage, but often just cheese is perfect.\n",
      "The crust should have good chew and those nice air bubbles from proper fermentation.\n",
      "Places like Regina's or Santarpio's represent what pizza should be to me.\n",
      "But I eat it less frequently now, maybe once a month, usually when grandchildren visit and want something familiar.\n",
