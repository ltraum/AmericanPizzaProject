# American Pizza Project

Welcome to the American Pizza Project! 


The American Pizza Project aims to capture the diverse philosophies and regional differences in pizza appreciation across the United States. A nationally representative set of pseudo interviews was conducted (Thanks Claude!) in which each participant provided detailed responses (around 200 words) to the following prompts about their personal pizza related life experiences:

1) Describe a turning point in your life when your taste or appreciation for pizza changed. Share the story or explain why there hasn't been a change.

2) Detail your ideal slice of pizza, including toppings, texture, sauce-cheese ratios, and your preferred regional style.

3) Explain when and how you typically eat pizza in your lifeâ€”on the go, with others, etc.

4) Discuss the importance of pizza boxes and utensils to your pizza eating experience.

5) Share any experiences of being unable to eat pizza when you wanted to due to dietary reasons, cost, lack of availability, or other barriers.

Following the survey, paticipants were asked to complete a brief survey detailing their place of residence, age, income, and diatary restrictions.

At the crux of the American Pizza Project lies the goal of identifying themes of the pizza experience that carry relevance beyond any one individual, and,  to achieve this end, we can explore computational tools! Play with the Jupyter notebooks to examine how well the inductive themebuilder Lloom extracts themes from the data under varied input and theme steering conditions! **Under what conditions is Lloom's theme gathering of the American Pizza Project most insightful?** The hope is to eventually expand exploration to include other themebuilding tools beyond Lloom as well.

In the notebooks as they currently stand, articularly interesting experimentation comes in choosing specific or broad seed theme terms (eg. "cheese" vs "taste") and/or choosing different unit input chunks of data to be analyzed. (eg. q1 vs q1+q2 vs q1+q2+q3 vs all)
Note, if number of participants is too small or if seed theme is too far-fetched from responses, an error will occur.

The raw American Pizza Project Data (Thanks again Claude!) as well as Lloom outputted theme summary examples are available in the "data" folder. Cloud dependant and locally runable lloom explorer notebooks are available in the "Lloom_experiment_Jupyter_notebooks" folder.
